# tensorflow_demo

### This is a demo following Martin GÃ¶rner's tensorflow demo. The original code can be found here: https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-mnist-tutorial

### The goal is to train a classifier for mnist dataset. Code is written in tensorflow, several models are used including softmax, neural network (sigmoid and relu as activation function). It also covers some regularization tricks like dropout and batch normalization.

### This demo also includes a python visulation script that allows visual effect of the training process, which is amazing!
